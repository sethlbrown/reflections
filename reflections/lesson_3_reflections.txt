**When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?**

If you're working from different machines, or with different people, you'd want to make sure and have a remote repository where code could be shared.


**Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?**

Having automatic synchronization might cause merge conflicts before you're ready to deal with them, and make what you're working on a moving target. Being able to choose when to manually pull changes gives you control.
